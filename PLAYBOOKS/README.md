# Bitcoin Hackathon Playbooks

Welcome to the Goose + Bitcoin Hackathon Playbooks! These guides are designed to help you leverage powerful tools like Block Goose (AI Agent), Alby (Bitcoin/Lightning Wallet & API), LDK (Lightning Dev Kit), Lightspark, Fewsats, Lexe, Spark Wallet, OpenSecret Cloud/Maple, and Inference Grid to build innovative projects.

## Main Playbooks

*   **[00 - Introduction to Tools](./00-Introduction-to-Tools/README.md)**
    *   **Goal**: Get familiar with the primary tools (Goose, Alby, LDK, Lightspark, Fewsats, Lexe, Spark Wallet, OpenSecret Cloud/Maple, Inference Grid) and their key capabilities for the hackathon.
    *   **Use If**: You're new to these tools or want a refresher on what they offer.

*   **[01 - AI-Powered Bitcoin Tip Bot](./01-AI-Powered-Bitcoin-Tip-Bot/README.md)**
    *   **Goal**: Build a bot (e.g., for Discord/X) that allows users to send Bitcoin Lightning tips using natural language, powered by Goose and Alby.
    *   **Use If**: You want to create an interactive application combining AI, social platforms, and Bitcoin micropayments.

*   **[02 - Automated Lightning Network Node Setup (with LDK)](./02-Automated-Lightning-Node-Setup/README.md)**
    *   **Goal**: Explore building a custom Lightning Network node or integrating Lightning deeply into an application using the Lightning Dev Kit (LDK), with Goose assisting in development.
    *   **Use If**: You're an advanced user interested in deep Lightning protocol customization, building unique Lightning-enabled applications, or learning LDK.

*   **[03 - AI-Driven Wallet Assistant](./03-AI-Driven-Wallet-Assistant/README.md)**
    *   **Goal**: Develop an AI assistant that helps users manage their Alby Bitcoin wallet using natural language commands, with Goose handling the AI logic.
    *   **Use If**: You're interested in natural language processing (NLU) and creating user-friendly interfaces for Bitcoin wallet interactions.
